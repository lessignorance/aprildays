#you occupied my mind...

_June 16, 2018_

I feel heartbroken every time I think of when you're gone. This is killing me. Time like this always give me an urge to tell you how I feel. I would write something for you. Or text you. Yet it doesn't last long. Of course I can't just keep sending you stuffs like this all the time. Although I have kept telling you about all this, I'm sure I would overwhelm you if you really knew about all these uncontrollably intense emotions in me.

When we met this afternoon at Bang Khuang cafe and yesterday evening at Snap, I told you a lot of things going on in my mind. I feel like I always want to lay out all my emotions before you. You know why now.

And there comes the problem. I can't imagine what it's like when you're gone. What's going on between us at the moment is much more than just a habit, more than just something we "get used to". You occupied my mind.
