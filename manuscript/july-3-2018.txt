#July 3, 2018

I am at the Coffee House, trying to recover from all the emotional nonsense. I'm feeling calmer. Maybe things should be left like this, and maybe the story of how I tried to reach for something I wasn't even fully aware of should have never happened in the first place.

You once mentioned the kind of "courage" needed to start a conversation, to open up one's heart and to get over all the vulnerabilities to actually "see" the other. But we have missed another kind of "courage" which one desperately needs, to be aware of the ongoing silence, to really appreciate the value of its existence before making a decision whether to break it.

The division bell has rung. And I feel like I'm just desperate in trying to rewind the time.
