I'm writing these lines for you at the Snap caf√©, listening to Pink Floyd's The Division Bell. The chill atmosphere here is so nice at the moment. How I wish you were here!

"We can talk later." I remember those last words I sent to you yesterday when I realized how tired you must have been after a long day. No wonder why the text fell into nowhere. At first I thought you must have fallen asleep already. Then I realized, actually I didn't know and didn't even have any way to know whether it had been your usual "quietly falling out of conversation" instead.

I told you to give me some signals when you feel I have penetrated into your life too much. Am I stupid or too stubborn to recognize all those signals? I'm even getting used to waiting for your hesitating replies to my text. I remember when I told you about the idea of "backing away", you pictured something like this: _"you would just stop interacting, of course you would still reply if I send you a text, but it would carry just enough information, under an indifferent voice instead... and then I would realize you have gone already."_ Isn't it what is happening at the moment?

I can't stand the idea of being a burden for another one, especially emotionally. I don't want anyone to be responsible for my feelings. The truth is usually much different from perspectives. People can only get things from their own perspectives and try to get as close as they can to the truth, without any real metrics to measure how close they have come. Things can get much more positive or negative depending on the perception of the person. I don't know if I'm just being too depressed at the moment to know better. But I have tried to watch my feeling over time and I did realize how connected it has been to your reactions. Isn't this what we call "emotional slavery"? I used to despise this state in others, and felt good with my rational and calm attitude towards life. Karma is a bitch and this sucks.
