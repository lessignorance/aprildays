#rainy afternoon

_June 20, 2018_

You're sitting right there. The rain starts to fall hard right behind you down through the leaves outside. For the first time, I'm fully aware of how much I love to be silent with you. To enjoy this same atmosphere. To breathe the same air. To share the same moments and feel the same inner peace.

And I can see the conflict in me rise again. I feel the urge to come to your place, give you a tight hug, hold you in my arms, sniff your wonderful hair, kiss your forehead, your eyes, your cheeks, your nose, your lips. And I would pull your body closed to mine. And tell you again and again and again that I love you. And that I don't want to lose you.

But if I ever had the courage to do all that, would it ruin our precious moments we're having?
