I'm listening to Duet of Rachael Yamagata, the very first song you sent me. The song gently blown all my worries away and transformed my inside storm into something so calm, that for a moment, I forgot everything else and just wish to have you here with me, in this dark room, to listen to this soothing music. The way they whisper into the silent night magically creates a healing atmosphere, which I didn't realize how badly I needed all these time. The troubled thoughts covering my mind recently seems to fade away at last, leaving behind a strange tranquility and awareness of what is going on in my life.

And I feel so thankful for all these experiences.

But why do her next songs in the auto-generated playlist all sound so sad?
