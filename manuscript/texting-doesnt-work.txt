#texting doesn't work

_June 18, 2018_

Texting doesn't work. I know it. But I just can't resist the "instant gratification" I kept telling you about. Texting is different from emailing in that it somehow creates an urgent sense of a need to reply on the recipient. And my impatience has been luring me into this path.

I just reread everything we have written to each other. I can see very clearly the shifts in our relationship, from long writings with careful thoughts to quick texts in a few hundred characters, from topics we love into trivial daily stuffs, from an enduring sense of longing and belonging to each other into something burning and addicting.

Again, I have known all these things beforehand, together with the concept of "ma" - emptiness - you sent me. It's just I found myself out of self-control in almost every aspects related to you. Not to mention the haunting feeling that we're running out of time together.

I just went through a series of articles regarding human relationship on BrainPickings. So my mind at the moment may still be occupied with mixed feelings and thoughts about all those ideas and concepts. However, I know it won't change much on all the things going on at the moment, it only helped me see things more clearly, with different perspectives now.

I read all articles about Kahlil Gibran and came to admire the man and his thoughts a lot.

>And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.
>And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.”
