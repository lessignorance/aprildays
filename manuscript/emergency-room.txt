#emergency room

_June 13, 2018_

Things tend to turn out in an unexpected way. Of course I could never imagine that one day I would be filled in as your emergency contact in the hospital.

I was on a rush when taking this photo to mark the day.

It took all my courage to tell you that I had fallen in love with you. Yet I'm feeling riddled with what is going on inside me. It always seems to me that people are too obsessed with classification for everything, even for abstract things such as feelings and relationship. And now it's ironic that I'm on the same path.

What is going on between us doesn't need a label. But when it's kind of overwhelming, isn't there a need, or more precisely, a desire, to express what we're feeling towards each other, and to know that the same is going on with the other?

It's too hard to turn my feelings into words. And there has always been a war inside me.

Em oi, no matter how much I crave hearing you say you love me, I guess what's between us is fine and beautiful the way it is.

And I won't ever take back what I said to you, my April light.

I love you with all my heart and soul
