#signal

_June 29, 2018_

This is not going well. Why is everything so hard to control, and why am I trying too hard? After all, is it only a projection that I follow? An illusion? Isn't it because we would never reach anywhere, so it hurts?

I tell myself again and again to stop texting you, stop bothering you, stop emailing and keep a distance. And of course you're quiet as always. I should have known. I asked for some signals. Isn't it the clearest one already? But why are you keeping me company, while at the same time you make the distance between us grow larger and larger day by day. You're here yet you're already so far away from my reach. What am I expecting from you? Is what's going on between us becoming a burden already?

Your sweet words now and then seem more and more like traps to me, the ones I kept falling for voluntarily. My heart was broken and then healed to be broken again. I can't ever mean anything more to you and I'm fucking jealous. And a question popped up in my mind, that how can you keep your long-distance relationship going for all these years?

You're gone in no time. And I'm not ready at all, as much as I tried to tell myself and as much as I joked about it when I was with you. I wish you were mine and mine only. What's going on between us is no more than some sort of consolation before everything turns into ashes. Impermanence is something you thought you were able to be fully aware of, until you realize it's doesn't care about your awareness at all. It just happens and kills you on the way.

Wish I could be more content with the present. I'm disappointed with all my meditation and all those years living in equanimity.
