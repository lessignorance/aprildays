#a week after you came back

_May 23, 2018_

I'm listening to a playlist of all the songs you sent, those and some other songs of mine that I found going together well. They helped bring some peace for my mind after a long day.

I know I have said this already, even repeatedly, but I started to fear that I'm overwhelming you with all the feelings and thoughts I'm having. These words I have written over and over again, together with a whole bunch of other gibberish, and I have to throw away most of them, since words seems not to work anymore. I think I should blame this on your trips, both the recent and the coming one, em.

Today Youtube "recommended" me this song: https://youtu.be/PYD-DIggB2k. I didn't know Paul Simon & Garfunkel has this song. Well, it's not really match your case, but at least the timeline is correct.

When you were gone on your trip, I thought we would see each other more when you're back. It seems to be false hope, with all the things life keeps throwing at us these days. I'm looking forward to our trip this Fri, but of course we should only go if you're fully recovered.

How were your recent days?
