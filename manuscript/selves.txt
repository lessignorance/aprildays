#selves

_June 21, 2018_

I was reading our emails from the very first day, and I realized how much space we need for each other to grow. I feel like all my emotions these weeks are burning and changing everything between us slowly and silently. I remember well the longing days when you were gone on your trip. They defined a lot in me and they gave us room to find our true selves. The two periods are much different.

So there comes again the needs of balance. No matter how calm and balanced my outer self seems to be, I often find myself go completely to one extreme end or another. Sometimes I even wonder how other beings could be so at ease with their own situations. Of course, we can never know how another being actually feels and what is in one's mind that leads to one's decision. We only know about our part in the picture after all.

When I found you, you open my whole world and brought my inner self out of my mind into the real world. But isn't that very same self creating its own outer mask at the moment, driven by all the burning emotions, cravings and impatience?

And after all, all those selves made me myself.

As always, comfort zone is a disaster.
