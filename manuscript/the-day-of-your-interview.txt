the day of your interview

_June 26, 2018_

Today you gave me a long hug that I didn't expect. At that moment I realized a simple truth of how much I care for you, and how I wish the best for you, and that it's all I could do for you because after all, I wouldn't be able to become something more to you as much as I want to.

I want you to know that I would always be there for you when you need me. And that I would also stay out of your way if you ever need me to do so.

There is no doubt that I'm able to do it, even when I know how much pain it would bring me.

I miss you again.
